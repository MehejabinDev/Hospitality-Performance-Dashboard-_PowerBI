🏨📊Hospitality Performance Dashboard
I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard by connecting to a SQL database using the ODBC connector. Data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, including handling null values, correcting data types, and creating calculated columns. I built an optimized data model with proper relationships and created KPIs using DAX such as total revenue, booking trends, and occupancy rate. The dashboard includes KPI cards, column and line charts, and slicers with dynamic filtering. I also focused on professional formatting and performance optimization to deliver clear, actionable business insights.
